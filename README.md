**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**	## Supported Browsers


If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.	`By default, the generated project supports all modern browsers.`  



Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.	## Scripts


You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.	- `npm run clean` Deletes Build files of Server and Client
- `npm run build` Builds Server and Client
- `npm start` Start server in production environment
